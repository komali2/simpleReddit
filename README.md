Front page of reddit is shown by default. Check/uncheck boxes to choose which are displayed. Type in your favorite subreddit's title (without the /r/) to grab it from reddit. 

Styling uses flexbox for structure and ng-animate for animations. Styling is inspired by Google Material Design. All styling was done by hand, with no external libraries.
